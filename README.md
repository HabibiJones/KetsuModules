# Origin
This was forked from a community-based modules (https://github.com/Bilnaa/Ketsu-Modules) but sadly they've been archived as their modules slowly become outdated.
So I've taken some time to update some modules I personal use for everyone to enjoy.

# Creator
Orion is the creator of Katsu/Ketsu modular viewers that work through custom modules to read/watch media.

(While katsu is openly avalible in the appstore ketsu is not)

# What is Katsu/Ketsu ?
They are modular applications, which means that you can create your own modules and use them to read differents types of novels, comics, and anime(ketsu only). 

# How can I download Ketsu since it's not available in the App Store anymore ?
You can sideload it on your iDevice. While you can download and use it freely on MacOS
For iphones and ipads you must sideload them with free softwares like [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/), or paid ones (that last longer) like signuluous.
You will find tutorials made by the creator in English [here](https://ketsu.app/download.html) and one in French made by me [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX2MAsUBdfQ).

You can find the ipa file here [Ketsu](https://ketsu.app).

# Can I make a module ? 
If you atleast sometime experienced with JavaScript you can easily make one too. The creator has made a website and templates that allow you to learn the logic and framework of Ketsu.
This repo is not just for me but the community so if you want to get into JS you can contribute them here.
If you have a github account make a pull request with the name and type (Image, Video or text) of the modules you've made.
And if you ever need help you can hit up me or other module makers in the [Ketsu discord](https://discord.gg/CP3Q6XBv9F) by just mentioning me @scrumptious_ or others.
