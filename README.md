# Origin
This is forked repo from a former another repo (https://github.com/Bilnaa/Ketsu-Modules) but has been retired.
So I've taken the liberty to update and even make new modules for everyone to enjoy.

# What is Katsu/Ketsu ?
The creator of Katsu/Ketsu made modular so they work through custom modules to read and watch mangas/manhwas/novels/animes(ketsu only).

While Katsu is openly avalible in the appstore, Ketsu is not

# How can I download Ketsu ?
You can freely sideload Ketsu on all your iDevices but also download and use it freely on MacOS.
For IPhones and IPads you must sideload them with softwares like [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) and [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/), or through paid methods like certificate-based signing (Ex. Iosgods/Signulous).

You can find tutorials made by the creator in English [here](https://ketsu.app/download.html) and one in French made by Nabil [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX2MAsUBdfQ).

# Can I make a module ? 
Even if your only a little seasoned with JavaScript you can easily make one too. The creator has resources and templates that allow you to learn the logic and framework of Ketsu to make your own modules.
This repo is not just for me but the community so if you want to get into module making you can contribute them here or on your own and if you have a github account make a push request with your module and I'll glady accept them.
And if you ever need help you can hit up me or other module makers in the [Ketsu discord](https://discord.gg/CP3Q6XBv9F).

# How does it work ?
With Z/Ketsu you script JS modules that scrap data from website and format them into json outputs that the apps read and display.
For example, Asurascans is a popular manhwa scanlation and with just a module we can access the web grab media like their comics and display them freely on the app.
