# Origin
This is forked repo from a former community-based repo (https://github.com/Bilnaa/Ketsu-Modules) but has sadly been archived.
So I've taken the liberty to update and even make new modules for everyone to enjoy.

The creator of Katsu/Ketsu made them modular apps that work through custom modules to read and watch mangas/manhwas/novels/animes across many different platforms.

# What is Katsu/Ketsu ?
They are modular applications, which means that you can create your own modules and use them to read differents types of novels, comics, and anime(ketsu only). 

(While Katsu is openly avalible in the appstore, Ketsu is not)

# How can I download Ketsu ?
You can freely sideload it on all your iDevice. While you can download and use it freely on MacOS.
For iphones and ipads you must sideload them with softwares like [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) and [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/), or paid ones (that last longer) like signuluous (cert-based signing).
You can find tutorials made by the creator in English [here](https://ketsu.app/download.html) and one in French made by Nabil(former maker) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX2MAsUBdfQ).

You can find the ipa file here [Ketsu](https://ketsu.app).

# Can I make a module ? 
Even if your only a little seasoned with JavaScript you can easily make one too. The creator has resources and templates that allow you to learn the logic and framework of Ketsu to make your own.
This repo is not just for me but the community so if you want to get into module making you can contribute them here or on your own and if you have a github account make a push request with your module and I'll glady accept them.
And if you ever need help you can hit up me or other module makers in the [Ketsu discord](https://discord.gg/CP3Q6XBv9F).

# How does it work ?
With Z/Ketsu you script JS modules that scrap data from website and format them into json outputs that the apps read and display.
For example, Asurascans is a popular manhwa scanlation and with just a module we can access the web grab media like their comics and display them freely on the app.
