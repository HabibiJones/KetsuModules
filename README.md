# Origin
This is forked repo from a former repo (https://github.com/Bilnaa/Ketsu-Modules) but has been retired.
So I've taken the liberty to host, update, and even make new modules for everyone to enjoy.

# What is Katsu/Ketsu ?
The creator of Katsu/Ketsu made these application modular so the user has the freedom to develop their own modules to browse any site they'd entail.
Whether its skimming miles of text or navigating catacombs of videos/images it can be done with ZKetsu.

You've may have noticed that Katsu is the only one you can see openly in the appstore.
See Katsu is actually a outdated version of what is now KETSU but is only avaliable through sideloading or jailbreaking due to their creators's concern.

# Where can I download Ketsu ?

[Ketsu Homepage](https://ketsu.app).

You can freely sideload Ketsu on all your iDevices but also download and use it freely on MacOS.
For IPhones and IPads you must sideload them with softwares like [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) and [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/), or through paid methods like certificate-based signing (Ex. Iosgods/Signulous).

You can find tutorials made by the creator in English [here](https://ketsu.app/download.html) and one in French made by Nabil [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX2MAsUBdfQ).

# Can I make a module ? 
Even if your only a little seasoned with JavaScript you can easily make one too. There a bit of documentation here and there on how to make your own.
But this repo servers as one as well. There sometimes many obstacles you must cross to be able to get your module working how you want and here I store all those methods whether its advance queryselection to async browsing its all here for you to discover.
And if you ever need help you can hit up me or other module makers in the [Ketsu discord](https://discord.gg/CP3Q6XBv9F).

# How does it work ?
With Z/Ketsu you script JS modules packaged in JSON that scrap data from websites and format them into outputs that the apps read and display.
For example, Asurascans is a popular manhwa scanlation and with just a module we can access the web and grab media like their comics and showcase them freely on the app.
